    text: "Always wanted a go-to product that could freshen my room instantly. I’m glad I stumbled upon these products...not only do they have beautiful aromas based on different flowers (great idea tbh), which I loved, but they also enhance the overall vibe cuz they’re cute candles, not artificial perfumes. Worth the money, I’d say. Go for it. ✌️",

    text: "I was skeptical about 'Pahli Baarish'—like, how can you bottle the smell of mud? But WOW. It literally smells like the first rain in my village. I’ve bought Bath & Body Works before, but this feels more real? Maybe because it’s handmade.",

    text: "Honestly, I bought the Lavender one just to make my hostel room smell less... damp. But now it’s my permanent study buddy. I light it up during all-nighters, and it actually keeps me calm. The crackling sound is so satisfying when everything else is silent. 10/10 recommending to my wingmates.",
